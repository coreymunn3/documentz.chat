# Product Context: Documentz.chat

## Why This Project Exists

Documentz.chat was created to address the common challenge of extracting information from lengthy PDF documents. Many professionals, students, and researchers spend significant time reading through PDFs to find specific information or understand key concepts. This process is often time-consuming and inefficient.

By transforming static PDFs into interactive conversations, Documentz.chat aims to revolutionize how people interact with document content, making information retrieval faster, more intuitive, and more efficient.

## Problems It Solves

### Information Accessibility

- **Problem**: Important information is buried within lengthy documents, making it difficult to find quickly.
- **Solution**: AI-powered chat interface that can instantly answer specific questions about document content.

### Document Understanding

- **Problem**: Complex documents can be difficult to comprehend in their entirety.
- **Solution**: Ability to ask clarifying questions and get summaries of document sections.

### Time Efficiency

- **Problem**: Reading entire documents to find specific information is time-consuming.
- **Solution**: Direct question-answering that points users to relevant sections, saving hours of reading time.

### Knowledge Retention

- **Problem**: Information from documents is often forgotten after reading.
- **Solution**: Conversational interface that reinforces understanding through interactive Q&A.

### Document Management

- **Problem**: Important PDFs are scattered across devices and cloud storage.
- **Solution**: Centralized storage with cloud backup and accessibility from any device.

## How It Should Work

### User Journey

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Users create an account or log in using Clerk authentication.
2. **Document Upload**: Users upload PDF documents to their dashboard.
3. **Document Selection**: Users select a document from their dashboard to view or chat with.
4. **Document Viewing**: The application displays the PDF in an interactive viewer.
5. **AI Conversation**: Users ask questions about the document in a chat interface.
6. **AI Response**: The system provides answers based on document content, with references to specific sections.
7. **Subscription Management**: Users can upgrade to premium features through Stripe integration.

### Technical Flow

1. **Document Processing**: When a PDF is uploaded, it's stored in Firebase Storage.
2. **Text Extraction**: The system extracts text from the PDF.
3. **Vector Embedding**: The text is processed and stored as vector embeddings in Pinecone.
4. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, the system uses the embeddings to find relevant content.
5. **Response Generation**: OpenAI's models generate contextually relevant answers.
6. **Response Streaming**: Answers are streamed to the user in real-time.
7. **Conversation History**: Chat history is stored in Firebase for future reference.
