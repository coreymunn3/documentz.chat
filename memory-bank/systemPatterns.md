# System Patterns: Documentz.chat

## System Architecture

Documentz.chat follows a modern web application architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend Architecture

The application uses Next.js with the App Router pattern, providing a robust framework for server-side rendering, client-side navigation, and API routes. The frontend is structured as follows:

- **App Directory**: Contains page components organized by route
- **Components Directory**: Reusable UI components
- **Hooks Directory**: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- **Actions Directory**: Server actions for backend operations
- **Lib Directory**: Utility functions and service integrations

### Backend Architecture

The backend functionality is implemented through a combination of:

- **Next.js API Routes**: For handling API requests
- **Server Actions**: For secure server-side operations
- **Firebase**: For database and storage
- **Pinecone**: For vector database operations
- **OpenAI**: For AI model interactions

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **User Authentication Flow**: Clerk handles user authentication and session management
2. **Document Upload Flow**: Client → Firebase Storage → Vector Processing → Pinecone
3. **Chat Flow**: User Query → Vector Search → AI Processing → Streaming Response
4. **Subscription Flow**: User → Stripe → Webhook → Database Update

## Key Technical Decisions

### Next.js App Router

The application uses Next.js App Router for routing and rendering, which provides:

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load performance
- Client-side navigation for smooth user experience
- API routes for backend functionality
- Server actions for secure server-side operations

### Firebase Integration

Firebase was chosen for:

- Real-time database capabilities for chat and document updates
- Scalable file storage for PDF documents
- Authentication integration (alongside Clerk)
- Serverless architecture that scales with usage

### Vector Embeddings with Pinecone

Pinecone was selected for:

- Efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings
- Scalable vector search capabilities
- Low latency for real-time query responses
- Namespace organization for document separation

### LangChain Integration

LangChain provides:

- Structured framework for AI interactions
- Document chunking and processing
- Context-aware retrieval chains
- Streaming response capabilities

### Stripe Payment Processing

Stripe handles:

- Secure payment processing
- Subscription management
- Webhook integration for payment events
- Customer portal for subscription management

## Design Patterns in Use

### Component Patterns

1. **Compound Components**: UI elements like the chat interface are built using compound components that work together
2. **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation of data fetching and presentation logic
3. **Higher-Order Components**: For shared functionality across components
4. **Custom Hooks**: For reusable stateful logic

### State Management Patterns

1. **React Context**: For theme and global state management
2. **Firebase Hooks**: For real-time data synchronization
3. **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state
4. **Server State**: For data that requires server validation

### Data Fetching Patterns

1. **Server Actions**: For secure server-side operations
2. **React Query Patterns**: For client-side data fetching and caching
3. **Streaming Responses**: For real-time AI responses
4. **Optimistic Updates**: For responsive UI during data operations

### Error Handling Patterns

1. **Try/Catch Blocks**: For graceful error handling
2. **Error Boundaries**: For containing component errors
3. **Toast Notifications**: For user-friendly error messages
4. **Fallback UI**: For degraded but functional experience during errors

## Component Relationships

### Core Component Structure

```
App
├── Layout (global layout with header/footer)
│   ├── Dashboard (document management)
│   │   ├── Documents (document listing)
│   │   ├── FileUploader (document upload)
│   │   └── UpgradeButton (subscription management)
│   ├── DocumentView (individual document)
│   │   ├── PdfView (PDF display)
│   │   └── Chat (document chat)
│   └── Settings (user settings)
```

### Component Communication

1. **Parent-Child Props**: For direct component communication
2. **Context API**: For global state sharing
3. **Custom Events**: For cross-component communication
4. **URL Parameters**: For route-based state

### Data Flow Between Components

1. **Document Selection**: Dashboard → DocumentView
2. **Chat Interaction**: Chat → API → Chat
3. **Upload Process**: FileUploader → Storage → Dashboard
4. **Subscription Changes**: UpgradeButton → Stripe → Dashboard

## Technical Constraints and Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: For reduced bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: For faster loading
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: For dynamic content with static benefits
- **Memoization**: For expensive computations

### Security Measures

- **Server Actions**: For secure server-side operations
- **Authentication Checks**: For protected routes and actions
- **Environment Variables**: For sensitive configuration
- **Content Security Policy**: For XSS protection

### Scalability Approach

- **Serverless Architecture**: For automatic scaling
- **Edge Caching**: For improved global performance
- **Database Indexing**: For efficient queries at scale
- **Optimized Vector Search**: For handling large document collections

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Semantic HTML**: For screen reader compatibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: For motor impairment accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: For visual impairment accessibility
- **ARIA Attributes**: For enhanced screen reader information
