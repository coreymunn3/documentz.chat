## Current Status

The application is in a functional MVP state with all core features implemented. Users can:

1. Sign up and log in
2. Upload PDF documents (with limits based on subscription tier)
3. View uploaded documents in an interactive PDF viewer
4. Chat with the AI about document content
5. Upgrade to premium tier for additional features
6. Manage their subscription

The system architecture is established with:

- Next.js frontend with App Router
- Firebase for database and storage
- Pinecone for vector embeddings
- OpenAI for AI capabilities
- Stripe for payment processing

Development and production environments are configured with appropriate environment variables and service configurations.

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. **PDF Processing Limitations**:

   - Some complex PDF formats may not extract text correctly
   - Large PDFs (>50MB) may experience slower processing times
   - PDFs with heavy image content have limited text extraction

2. **AI Response Quality**:

   - Occasional hallucinations in complex document contexts
   - Limited context window can affect understanding of very large documents
   - Response quality varies based on document clarity and structure

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Initial vector embedding generation can be slow for large documents
   - Chat response time increases with document complexity
   - High concurrent usage may affect response times

### User Experience Issues

1. **Upload Experience**:

   - Limited feedback during the embedding generation process
   - No retry mechanism for failed uploads
   - No progress indication for vector processing

2. **Chat Interface**:

   - No way to save or bookmark important responses
   - Limited context management for complex conversations
   - No way to export chat history

3. **Document Management**:
   - No search functionality for documents
   - Limited organization options (no folders or tags)
   - No batch operations for document management

### Business Model Considerations

1. **Subscription Tiers**:

   - Current tier limits may need adjustment based on user feedback
   - Limited analytics on user usage patterns
   - No enterprise-specific offering

2. **Cost Management**:
   - AI API usage costs scale with user activity
   - Vector database costs increase with document volume
   - Storage costs grow with user base expansion

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current status and known issues, the following priorities have been identified:

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Improve PDF processing speed and reliability
   - Optimize vector search for faster responses
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

2. **User Experience Enhancements**:

   - Add document search functionality
   - Implement basic organization features
   - Improve error handling and recovery

3. **Business Model Refinement**:
   - Gather usage metrics to inform tier adjustments
   - Implement basic analytics for business insights
   - Evaluate cost optimization opportunities
